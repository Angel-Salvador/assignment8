	<h1>Daily Cat Fact!</h1>
	<p>
		The API I used was one that gave a cute fun fact about cats. 
		This API gives different facts everyday!
		<br><br>
		I found it at <a href="https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/">this website</a>. 
		<br><br>
		The option I used for this was the text tag. 
		<br><br>
		One of the applications where this API would be helpful would be for 
		a museum's exhibit about cats. Every day is a new fact, so people who visit 
		often can come to a new fact every time! Another application where this would be useful 
		would be for a cat cafe, where they have a large menu which can display 
		a cute fun cat fact at the bottom of the menu to add to the theme.
